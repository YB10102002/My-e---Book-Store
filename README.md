# My-e---Book-Store
This is my first project on github.today my project is responsible for managning the books digitally.

Problem:
The primary problem is the need for an efficient, secure, and user-friendly online platform where users can browse, purchase, and manage e-books. Current solutions fail to offer seamless integration between browsing and purchasing processes, leading to user frustration. Additionally, ensuring data security and personalized user experiences remains a significant challenge.![image](https://github.com/YB10102002/My-e---Book-Store/assets/161114315/162a808d-8ca3-4c75-98ab-f0edbc12d0e7)
